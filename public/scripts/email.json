Bought used by me at\nSkillman\'s Furniture 3 years ago for $40.  Great condition, very sturdy.\nGood for card games, space to put stuff.  Selling for *$20* -  pickup\nwhenever.\n\n1 Lasko 20" 3-speed box fan with original box.  Great for putting in a\nwindow and keeping your way too hot dorm room under control.  Bought from\nthe Ustore for ~$20 this fall, selling for *$10*. Pickup June 2 or June 3.\n\n1 plastic storage container: approx 12"(tall)x24"x16", not quite as big at\nthe bottom as at the top. Bought for $12 from Ustore last fall, used to\nstore clothing. Selling for *$5* - pickup whenever.\n\n2 crates 10"(tall)x15"x13": Bought from the ustore this fall, for $10/each,\ngreat for storing random small stuff (hats & gloves, games, plates,\nutensils etc.) in a closet, wardrobe, under your bed, or in the car on your\nway home this summer. Selling for *$4 each, or $7 for both* - pickup\nwhenever.\n\nBox of ~30 slimline hangers (box is 15"(tall)x15.5"x7": Bought lightly used\nfor $10 at the end of freshman year.
